# Galactica_Game
A basic game similar to Galaga written in Python using Pygame library. This project will use PyGame to create a Galaga-esque game. You will pilot a ship that is flying through an asteroid field and have to shoot the asteroids to survive. After getting enough points the game will end and you can exit.
